# Tracker

React SPA front-end dashboard application integrated with Firebase backend and authentication.

![# Tracker](documentation/tracker.jpg)

## Description

This is an application which acts as a complete client, domain and project tracker for web development agencies. Users can add, edit and delete resources, as well as assigning domains to clients, and clients to projects. Features include a realtime markdown parser for the documentation section, full CRUD functionality and authentication.

## Motivation

I built this application to produce a real-world product which solves problems for web development agencies, whilst learning more about React, authentication, back-end interactions and overall application scale.

### Available Scripts

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
